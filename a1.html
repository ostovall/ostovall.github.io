  <h1>Assignment 1: Blinking LEDs</h1>

  <h2>Schematic</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="schematic.png" alt="Three-LED Arduino schematic" width="720">
    <figcaption>Three LEDs on digital pins 2, 3, and 4. Each LED uses a 330 Ω series resistor to limit current. Cathodes to GND.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Resistor Calculation</h3>
  <p>R = (5V − Vf) / I. With Vf ≈ 2.0–2.2V and I = 10 mA, R ≈ 280–300 Ω. I used 330 Ω for safety and part availability. P ≈ 0.033 W.</p>

  <h2>Firmware (code snippet)</h2>
  <pre><code>
  // Declare an integer variable to store the pin number for the red LED
int redLED = 2;

// Declare an integer variable to store the pin number for the yellow LED
int yellowLED = 3;

// Declare an integer variable to store the pin number for the green LED
int greenLED = 4;

// The setup() function runs once when the Arduino powers on or resets
void setup() {
  // Set the red LED pin to OUTPUT mode so the Arduino can send voltage to it
  pinMode(redLED, OUTPUT);

  // Set the yellow LED pin to OUTPUT mode so the Arduino can send voltage to it
  pinMode(yellowLED, OUTPUT);

  // Set the green LED pin to OUTPUT mode so the Arduino can send voltage to it
  pinMode(greenLED, OUTPUT);
}

// The loop() function runs repeatedly after setup() finishes
void loop() {
  // Turn the red LED ON by sending 5 volts to its pin
  digitalWrite(redLED, HIGH);

  // Turn the yellow LED OFF to make sure only red is lit
  digitalWrite(yellowLED, LOW);

  // Turn the green LED OFF to make sure only red is lit
  digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW);

  // Wait for one second (1000 milliseconds) before changing LEDs
  delay(1000);

  // Turn the red LED OFF before switching to yellow
  digitalWrite(redLED, LOW);

  // Turn the yellow LED ON by sending 5 volts to its pin
  digitalWrite(yellowLED, HIGH);

  // Keep the green LED OFF while yellow is on
  digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW);

  // Wait for one second before switching to the next LED
  delay(1000);

  // Make sure the red LED is OFF
  digitalWrite(redLED, LOW);

  // Make sure the yellow LED is OFF
  digitalWrite(yellowLED, LOW);

  // Turn the green LED ON by sending 5 volts to its pin
  digitalWrite(greenLED, HIGH);

  // Wait for one second before repeating the pattern
  delay(1000);

  <h2>Operation (Animated GIF)</h2>

    <figcaption>Sequential blink: red → yellow → green → repeat (1 s per LED).</figcaption>

  <h2>Q1. Voltage vs Time</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="voltage_graph.png" alt="Hand-drawn voltage versus time graph for red, yellow, and green LEDs" width="720">
  <figcaption>
    Hand-drawn graph showing voltage (Y-axis) versus time (X-axis) for the three LEDs.  
    Each LED rises to about 5 V for one second in sequence:  
    red (0–1 s), yellow (1–2 s), green (2–3 s).  
    The square-wave lines represent when each LED is ON.

  <h2>Q2–Q5. Answers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>See timing graph above.</li>
    <li>Up to 12 using pins 2–13 (avoid 0/1), or 18 if also using A0–A5 as digital. At 10 mA each: 120–180 mA total; distribute across ports and stay under MCU limits.</li>
    <li>About 60 Hz for many people; 100 Hz appears steady to nearly everyone.</li>
    <li>AI was used for drafting and formatting; I verified all wiring, code, and results.</li>
